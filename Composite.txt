Python is an interpreted highlevel generalpurpose programming language Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 Pythons design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace Its language constructs and objectoriented approach aim to help programmers write clear logical code for small and largescale projectsPython is dynamically typed and garbagecollected It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural objectoriented and  functional programming Python is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard libraryPython was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language Python 20 released 2000 introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles Python 30 released 2008 was a major revision of the language that is not completely backwardcompatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3 Due to concern about the amount of code written for Python 2 support for Python 27 the last release in the 2x series was extended to 2020 Language developer Guido van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project until July 2018 but now shares his leadership as a member of a fiveperson steering councilPython interpreters are available for many operating systems A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython an open source reference implementation A nonprofit organization the Python Software Foundation manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development

Cricket is a batandball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20metre 22yard pitch with a wicket at each end each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player so they are out Means of dismissal include being bowled when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground When ten players have been dismissed the innings ends and the teams swap roles The game is adjudicated by two umpires aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches They communicate with two offfield scorers who record the matchs statistical information

There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs to Test matches played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length Traditionally cricketers play in allwhite kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours In addition to the basic kit some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string

Historically crickets origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in southeast England in the middle of the 16th century It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century The games governing body is the International Cricket Council ICC which has over 100 members twelve of which are full members who play Test matches The games rules are held in a code called the Laws of Cricket which is owned and maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club MCC in London The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent Australasia the United Kingdom southern Africa and the West Indies its globalisation occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and remaining popular into the 21st century Womens cricket which is organised and played separately has also achieved international standard The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia having won seven One Day International trophies including five World Cups more than any other country and having been the toprated Test side more than any other country

Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde  Informatica CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language itself inspired by SETL capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system Its implementation began in December 1989 Van Rossum continued as Pythons lead developer until July 12 2018 when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Pythons Benevolent Dictator For Life a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his longterm commitment as the projects chief decisionmaker In January 2019 active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon Nick Coghlan Barry Warsaw Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a fivemember Steering Council to lead the projectPython 20 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features including a cycledetecting garbage collector and support for UnicodePython 30 was released on 3 December 2008 It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backwardcompatible Many of its major features were backported to Python 26x and 27x version series  Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility which automates at least partially the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3Python 27s endoflife date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forwardported to Python 3 In January 2017 Google announced work on a Python 27 to Go transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads

Cricket is one of many games in the club ball sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a handheld implement others include baseball golf hockey tennis squash badminton and table tennis In crickets case a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure the wicket originally it is thought a wicket gate through which sheep were herded that the batsman must defend The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three groups of club ball games the hockey group in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets the goals the golf group in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target the hole and the cricket group in which the ball is aimed at a mark the wicket and driven away from itIt is generally believed that cricket originated as a childrens game in the southeastern counties of England sometime during the medieval period Although there are claims for prior dates the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday 17 January 1597 Julian calendar equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59yearold coroner John Derrick who gave witness that

Given Derricks age it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c 1550 by boys in Surrey The view that it was originally a childrens game is reinforced by Randle Cotgraves 1611 EnglishFrench dictionary in which he defined the noun crosse as the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket and the verb form crosser as to play at cricketOne possible source for the sports name is the Old English word cryce or cricc meaning a crutch or staff In Samuel Johnsons Dictionary he derived cricket from cryce Saxon a stick In Old French the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick Given the strong medieval trade connections between southeast England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch in use in Flanders at the time kricke meaning a stick crook Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de krik ketsen ie with the stick chase Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin

Readability countsRather than having all of its functionality built into its core Python was designed to be highly extensible This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications Van Rossums vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC which espoused the opposite approachPython strives for a simpler lesscluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology In contrast to Perls there is more than one way to do it motto Python embraces a there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it design philosophy Alex Martelli a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author writes that To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python culturePythons developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to noncritical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity When speed is important a Python programmer can move timecritical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C or use PyPy a justintime compiler Cython is also available which translates a Python script into C and makes direct Clevel API calls into the Python interpreter

An important goal of Pythons developers is keeping it fun to use This is reflected in the languages name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials such as examples that refer to spam and eggs from a famous Monty Python sketch instead of the standard foo and barA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well that it is natural or shows fluency in the language that it conforms with Pythons minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability In contrast code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic

Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and all along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low twostump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticksIn 1611 the year Cotgraves dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised interparish or village match was played  at Chevening Kent In 1624 a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in SussexCricket remained a lowkey local pursuit for much of the century It is known through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be profane if played on the Sabbath especially if large crowds andor gambling were involvedAccording to the social historian Derek Birley there was a great upsurge of sport after the Restoration in 1660 Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act limiting stakes to £100 which was in any case a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99 of the population Along with prizefighting horse racing and blood sports cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport Rich patrons made matches for high stakes forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players By the end of the century cricket had developed into a major sport which was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers  the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676 A 1697 newspaper report survives of a great cricket match played in Sussex for fifty guineas apiece  this is the earliest known match that is generally considered topclassThe patrons and other players from the social class known as the gentry began to classify themselves as amateurs to establish a clear distinction visàvis the professionals who were invariably members of the working class even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities The gentry including such highranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their social inferiors if they were to win their bets In time a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in firstclass cricket until 1962 when amateurism was abolished was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University  society insisted that such people were officers and gentlemen whose destiny was to provide leadership In a purely financial sense the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee in practice many amateurs claimed somewhat more than actual expenditure and the derisive term shamateur was coined to describe the syndrome

The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become Englands national sport Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and in the middle years of the century large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match its popularity peaking in the 1748 season Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman This caused a revolution in bat design because to deal with the bouncing ball it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old hockey stick shapeThe Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club MCC and the opening of Lords Old Ground in 1787 Hambledon was both the games greatest club and its focal point MCC quickly became the sports premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket lbwThe 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling Both developments were controversial Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs starting with Sussex in 1839 In December 1889 the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship which began in 1890The most famous player of the 19th century was W G Grace who started his long and influential career in 1865 It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but in terms of their financial gain de facto professional Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professionalThe last two decades before the First World War have been called the Golden Age of cricket It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed

Meanwhile the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia the Caribbean India New Zealand North America and South Africa In 1844 the firstever international match took place between the United States and Canada In 1859 a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tourIn 1862 an English team made the first tour of Australia The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in 1868In 187677 an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the firstever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 and this has remained Test crickets most famous contest Test cricket began to expand in 188889 when South Africa played England

The assignment statement token = the equals sign This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages and this fundamental mechanism including the nature of Pythons version of variables illuminates many other features of the language Assignment in C eg x = 2 translates to typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2 The righthand value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the lefthand variable name is the symbolic address The memory allocated to the variable is large enough potentially quite large for the declared type In the simplest case of Python assignment using the same example x = 2 translates to generic name x receives a reference to a separate dynamically allocated object of numeric int type of value 2 This is termed binding the name to the object Since the names storage location doesnt contain the indicated value it is improper to call it a variable Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types including strings procedures complex objects with data and methods etc Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names eg x = 2 y = 2 z = 2 result in allocating storage to at most three names and one numeric object to which all three names are bound Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it However at a given time a name will be bound to some object which will have a type thus there is dynamic typing

Python does not support tail call optimization or firstclass continuations and according to Guido van Rossum it never will However better support for coroutinelike functionality is provided in 25 by extending Pythons generators Before 25 generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator From Python 25 it is possible to pass information back into a generator function and from Python 33 the information can be passed through multiple stack levels

In cricket the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket hereinafter called the Laws which has a global remit There are 42 Laws always written with a capital L The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and since 1788 it has been owned and maintained by its custodian the Marylebone Cricket Club MCC in London

Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples Lists are written as 1 2 3 are mutable and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in Python Tuples are written as 1 2 3 are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries provided all elements of the tuple are immutable The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples which does not directly modify their contents but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples Thus given the variable t initially equal to 1 2 3 executing t = t + 4 5 first evaluates t + 4 5 which yields 1 2 3 4 5 which is then assigned back to t thereby effectively modifying the contents of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts

Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable a writable property etc are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and as a whole are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left

Before a match begins the team captains who are also players toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match In each innings one team bats attempting to score runs while the other team bowls and fields the ball attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen When the first innings ends the teams change roles there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day During an innings all eleven members of the fielding team take the field but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time The exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run in this case the batsman is allowed A Runner who can run between the wickets when the batsman hits a scoring run or runs The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match but it can be variedThe main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but in some forms of cricket it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents they are said to have lost by n runs where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win it is said to have won by n wickets where n is the number of wickets left to fall For example a team that passes its opponents total having lost six wickets ie six of their batsmen have been dismissed have won the match by four wicketsIn a twoinningsaside match one teams combined first and second innings total may be less than the other sides first innings total The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs and does not need to bat again n is the difference between the two teams aggregate scores If the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs then the match is a tie this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in firstclass matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017 In the traditional form of the game if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win then the game is declared a drawIf the match has only a single innings per side then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings Such a match is called a limited overs or oneday match and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost so that a draw cannot occur If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather then a complex mathematical formula known as the DuckworthLewis method after its developers is often used to recalculate a new target score A oneday match can also be declared a noresult if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible for example wet weatherIn all forms of cricket the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue There have been instances of entire matches even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled for example the third Test of the 197071 series in Australia

Python has a string format operator  This functions analogous to printf format strings in C eg spam=s eggs=d  blah 2 evaluates to spam=blah eggs=2 In Python 3 and 26+ this was supplemented by the format method of the str class eg spam=0 eggs=1formatblah 2 Python 36 added fstrings blah = blah eggs = 2 fspam=blah eggs=eggs

Strings delimited by single or double quote marks Unlike in Unix shells Perl and Perlinfluenced languages single quote marks and double quote marks function identically Both kinds of string use the backslash  as an escape character String interpolation became available in Python 36 as formatted string literals
==========

==========
Triplequoted strings which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells Perl and Ruby
==========

Raw string varieties denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r Escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common such as regular expressions and Windowsstyle paths Compare quoting in C
==========

Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists denoted as akey astartstop or astartstopstep Indexes are zerobased and negative indexes are relative to the end Slices take elements from the start index up to but not including the stop index The third slice parameter called step or stride allows elements to be skipped and reversed Slice indexes may be omitted for example a returns a copy of the entire list Each element of a slice is a shallow copyIn Python a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp Scheme or Ruby This leads to duplicating some functionality For example

List comprehensions vs forloops

The bat is made of wood usually salix alba white willow and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle The blade must not be more than four and one quarter inches 108 mm wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches 965 mm There is no standard for the weight which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb 11 and 14 kgThe ball is a hard leatherseamed spheroid with a circumference of 229 centimetres 90 in The ball has a seam six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner During matches the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable and during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match Players will therefore attempt to modify the balls behaviour by modifying its physical properties Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the balls swing through the air but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball tampering
==========
Conditional expressions vs if blocks
==========

==========
The eval vs exec builtin functions in Python 2 exec is a statement the former is for expressions the latter is for statementsStatements cannot be a part of an expression so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions all being expressions cannot contain statements A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions if c = 1    is syntactically valid but probably unintended C code but if c = 1  causes a syntax error in Python

During normal play thirteen players and two umpires are on the field Two of the players are batsmen and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch The photo was taken during an international match between Australia and Sri Lanka Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka is bowling to Australian batsman Adam Gilchrist

While the umpire 1 in shot stands at the bowlers end of the pitch his colleague stands in the outfield usually in or near the fielding position called square leg so that he is in line with the popping crease 7 at the strikers end of the pitch The bowling crease not numbered is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases 12 The bowler 4 intends to hit the wicket 9 with the ball 5 or at least to prevent the striker 8 from scoring runs The striker 8 intends by using his bat to defend his wicket and if possible to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs

Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling so are termed allrounders Adam Gilchrist pictured above was a wicketkeeperbatsman another type of allrounder Bowlers are also classified according to their style generally as fast bowlers medium pace seam bowlers or like Muttiah Muralitharan pictured above spinners Batsmen are classified according to whether they are righthanded or lefthanded

Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names Type constraints are not checked at compile time rather operations on an object may fail signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type Despite being dynamically typed Python is strongly typed forbidding operations that are not welldefined for example adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them
==========

==========
Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes which are most often used for objectoriented programming New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example SpamClass or EggsClass and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself allowing metaprogramming and reflection
==========

==========
Before version 30 Python had two kinds of classes oldstyle and newstyle The syntax of both styles is the same the difference being whether the class object is inherited from directly or indirectly all newstyle classes inherit from object and are instances of type In versions of Python 2 from Python 22 onwards both kinds of classes can be used Oldstyle classes were eliminated in Python 30
==========
Of the eleven fielders three are in shot in the image above The other eight are elsewhere on the field their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler Fielders often change position between deliveries again as directed by the captain or bowlerIf a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match a substitute is allowed to field instead of him but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicketkeepers a situation that first occurred when Mumbai Indians wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan was injured in a match on 18 April 2018
==========
The long term plan is to support gradual typing and from Python 35 the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation CPython An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compiletime type checking

The captain is often the most experienced player in the team certainly the most tactically astute and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman a bowler or a wicketkeeper Within the Laws the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the LawsThe wicketkeeper sometimes called simply the keeper is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards Depending on their primary skills the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers Generally a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers plus the wicketkeeper

Python has the usual C language arithmetic operators +     It also has  for exponentiation eg 53

==========
 30 and a new matrix multiply  operator is included in version 35 Additionally it has a unary operator  which essentially inverts all the bits of its one argument For integers this means x=x1 Other operators include bitwise shift operators x  y which shifts x to the left y places the same as x2y  and x  y which shifts x to the right y places the same as x2y The behavior of division has changed significantly over time so that division between integers produces accurate floating point results
==========

==========
Python 21 and earlier use the C division behavior The  operator is integer division if both operands are integers and floatingpoint division otherwise Integer division rounds towards 0 eg 73

The wicketkeeper and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour 90 mph and presents a major health and safety concern Protective clothing includes pads designed to protect the knees and shins batting gloves or wicketkeepers gloves for the hands a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers to protect the crotch area Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads arm pads rib protectors and shoulder pads The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman ie if they are alongside or in front of him but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guardsSubject to certain variations onfield clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves long trousers woollen pullover if needed cricket cap for fielding or a safety helmet and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and firstclass cricket but in limited overs cricket team colours are worn instead

The innings ending with s in both singular and plural form is the term used for each phase of play during a match Depending on the type of match being played each team has either one or two innings Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but for various reasons an innings can end before they have all done so The innings terminates if the batting team is all out a term defined by the Laws at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in In this situation one of the batsman has not been dismissed and is termed not out this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress
==========

==========
An innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen
==========
==========
==========
the batting teams captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat this is a tactical decision by the captain usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings

Pythons large standard library commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths provides tools suited to many tasks For Internetfacing applications many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces connecting to relational databases generating pseudorandom numbers arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals manipulating regular expressions and unit testing
==========
the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time
==========
Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example the Web Server Gateway Interface WSGI implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333 but most modules are not They are specified by their code internal documentation and test suites if supplied However because most of the standard library is crossplatform Python code only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations

The Laws state that throughout an innings the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls The name over came about because the umpire calls Over when six balls have been bowled At this point another bowler is deployed at the other end and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs although a bowler can and usually does bowl alternate overs from the same end for several overs which are termed a spell The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over and so the one who was nonstriker is now the striker and viceversa The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the nonstrikers end and viceversa

The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowlers end the other in a position called square leg which is about 1520 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled ie not a noball or a wide when a run is scored whether a batsman is out the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire usually with the phrase Hows that or Owzat when intervals start and end and the suitability of the pitch field and weather for playing the game The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the lightOff the field in televised matches there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the gameThe match details including runs and dismissals are recorded by two official scorers one representing each team The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire see image right For example the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out has been dismissed he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored wickets taken and overs bowled in practice they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the gameA matchs statistics are summarised on a scorecard Prior to the popularisation of scorecards most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches According to Rowland Bowen the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T Pratt of Sevenoaks and soon came into general use It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lords for the first time in 1846

Besides observing the Laws cricketers must respect the Spirit of Cricket which is the Preamble to the Laws first published in the 2000 code and updated in 2017 and now opens with this statement
==========
Most Python implementations including CPython include a readevalprint loop REPL permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately
==========
Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws but also within the Spirit of Cricket
==========
Other shells including IDLE and IPython add further abilities such as autocompletion session state retention and syntax highlighting
==========
The Preamble is a short statement that emphasises the Positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadershipfriendship and teamworkThe major responsibility for ensuring fair play is placed firmly on the captains but extends to all players umpires teachers coaches and parents involved
==========
As well as standard desktop integrated development environments there are Web browserbased IDEs SageMath intended for developing science and mathrelated Python programs PythonAnywhere a browserbased IDE and hosting environment and Canopy IDE a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing
==========
The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player
==========

==========
Previous versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary for example appealing knowing that the batsman is not out but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes or left to the judgement of the umpires captains their clubs and governing bodies The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist on the detail of sportsmanship  or its absence

Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler although some are allrounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively If the captain wants a bowler to change ends another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediateA bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a runup and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his runup for the first delivery of that over the ball then being in play Fast bowlers needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour 90 mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing ie curve in flight This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be caught behind by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman A spinner will often buy his wicket by tossing one up in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batsman into making a poor shot The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be trapped into getting himself out In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsmans concentrationThere are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed five relatively common and five extremely rare The common forms of dismissal are bowled caught leg before wicket lbw run out and stumped Rare methods are hit wicket hit the ball twice obstructing the field handled the ball and timed out The Laws state that the fielding team usually the bowler in practice must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision If the batsman is out the umpire raises a forefinger and says Out otherwise he will shake his head and say Not out There is effectively an eleventh method of dismissal retired out which is not an onfield dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited

Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team Substitute batsmen are not allowedA skilled batsman can use a wide array of shots or strokes in both defensive and attacking mode The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bats blade If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an edge The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper Equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run A wide variety of shots are played the batsmans repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed eg cut drive hook pullThe batsman on strike ie the striker must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball To register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies the batsmen carry their bats as they run Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker

The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the balls progress and this is communicated by calling usually yes no or wait More than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary In these cases the batsmen do not need to run Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of overthrows by a fielder returning the ball If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was nonstriker is now the striker Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the teams totalAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras called sundries in Australia due to errors made by the fielding side This is achieved in four ways noball a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsmans reach bye an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsmans body though not his bat If the bowler has conceded a noball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball ie delivery has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball

Cricket is a multifaceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into firstclass cricket limited overs cricket and historically single wicket cricket The highest standard is Test cricket always written with a capital T which is in effect the international version of firstclass cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC see above Although the term Test match was not coined until much later Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 187677 Australian season since 1882 most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes The term firstclass in general usage is applied to toplevel domestic cricket Test matches are played over five days and firstclass over three to four days in all of these matches the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid resultLimited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day There are two types List A which normally allows fifty overs per team and Twenty20 in which the teams have twenty overs each Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals LOI and Twenty20 Internationals T20I List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the firstclass county clubs In 1969 a national league competition was established The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971 In 1975 the first Cricket World Cup took place in England Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours usually in an evening session The first Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007 Limited overs matches cannot be drawn although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a no resultSingle wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered topclass In this form although each team may have from one to six players there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full firstclass one and they could end in a draw
